# Latter-day Saint teachings supported by the Book of Mormon

"[The Book of Mormon] contains... the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ..." (Doctrine & Covenants 20:9). Joseph Smith taught that the fulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ "... includes all the doctrines, principles, laws, ordinances, and covenants necessary for us to be exalted in the celestial kingdom."

It is therefore natural to ask: which of the teachings of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are supported by the Book of Mormon?

The purpose of this project is to document Book of Mormon scriptural support for as many LDS gospel teachings as possible. A starting place is the [list of gospel topics on the church website](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics?lang=eng). [This Python notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1aQ52qfG9i1vl_ZFwXNT2LsV1Jcykk8bg?usp=sharing) downloads the descriptions for each of these gospel topics, checks whether the description refers to the Book of Mormon for support, and then prints a list of candidate topics. The output of this notebook was the basis for compiling the preliminary list of teachings.
